This app is made to handle your Household TTRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Game) characters,
which is currently being kickstarted here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2lm/household/
I personally plegded the Mouse Rider level :-)

DISCLAIMER:
Every image is the property of 2LM & CMON, I extracted everything from the quickstart guide & character sheets.
This is merely a personal project to help myself and any other Household player who prefer using their phones instead of paper sheets for their characters.
Some screenshots are available here: https://github.com/Viish/Household/tree/main/screenshots/

Note that I haven't tested it on many devices, feel free to open an issue with a screenshot if you have an issue with yours.
Also I haven't tested it on any tablet so far...

Currently it only contains pre-built characters, soon you will be able to add yours.
See CHANGELOG for more information.

Released under MIT license.

You can find a pre-built APK in the releases section: https://github.com/Viish/Household/releases
